🎯 Excel Data Analysis Practice Project
This project is a general-purpose practice to improve my skills in data cleaning, analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization using Microsoft Excel.

✨ Goals
- Practice cleaning messy and complex datasets
- Explore patterns and trends using Pivot Tables and formulas
- Apply hypothesis testing using Excel functions
- Visualize insights using charts and dashboard elements

💾 Dataset
The dataset used is not specific to HR, but selected for its complexity and variety of columns. This allows me to simulate real-world data analysis challenges.

🔍 Next Step
Apply the same logic and structure to real HR datasets and explore automation.
